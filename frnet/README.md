# Enhancing CTR Prediction with Context-Aware Feature Representation Learning
This is our implement for FRNet

### How to run the code.
1. Download corresponding datasets. 
   - [Criteo](https://labs.criteo.com/2014/02/download-kaggle-display-advertising-challenge-dataset/)
   - [Frappe](https://github.com/hexiangnan/neural_factorization_machine)
   - [Ml-tag](https://github.com/hexiangnan/neural_factorization_machine)
   - [Malware](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/microsoft-malware-prediction/data)

2. For example, put the Frappe or Ml-tag data in the corresponding folder.
3. Run the code with GPU:

    ```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_ml_base.py --choice 0```
